```{r}
library(tidyverse)


arrange(MLBpayrolls, TEAM, desc(Payroll.2016))


```



The first thing I wanted to do was find the quartiles... 
```{r}
#The first thing I wanted to do was find the quartiles... 

summary(MLBpayrolls)
```

Ah. I see the 1st Quartile is 57097310, so I will use that in my filter now... 

```{r}





MLBpayrolls %>% 
  filter(Payroll.2016< 89436812 | Payroll.2016>144913712) %>%
  select(TEAM, Payroll.2004) %>%
  arrange(Payroll.2004)
